- 👋 Hi, I’m @SampleGore
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new coding skills, Cyber Dev Ops, as well as general knowledge and information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity in college, as well as other fundamentals and practical applications via Codecademy and TryHackMe
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects here and there when I get them, I generally prefer just hints to solve problems, rather than it being done outright.
- 📫 How to reach me; I would prefer to only be contacted on here, if that's a possibility.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I thoroughly enjoy D&D, and have spent many MANY hours making worlds/campaigns to never play just because I enjoy worldbuilding.
